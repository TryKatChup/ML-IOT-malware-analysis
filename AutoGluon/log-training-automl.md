AutoGluon infers your prediction problem is: 'multiclass' (because dtype of label-column == int, but few unique label-values observed).
	7 unique label values:  [1, 7, 0, 9, 2, 5, 8]
	If 'multiclass' is not the correct problem_type, please manually specify the problem_type parameter during predictor init (You may specify problem_type as one of: ['binary', 'multiclass', 'regression'])
